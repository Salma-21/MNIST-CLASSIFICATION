# MNIST-CLASSIFICATION
This project, encompassing data exploration, model experimentation like ANNs and K-NN with hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using Confusion Matrix, provides a hands-on opportunity to apply machine learning concepts to real-world image classification challenges using the MNIST dataset.
